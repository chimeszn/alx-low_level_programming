For Task 3 - the script is a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

For Task 4 - the script is function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, except 2 and 4, followed by a new line.

For Task 5 - the script is a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line

For Task 6 - the script is a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

For Task 7 - the script is a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
